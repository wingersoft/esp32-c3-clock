# ESP32-C3 OLED NTP Clock Product Description

## Purpose
The ESP32-C3 OLED NTP Clock is a digital time display device that provides accurate timekeeping through network synchronization. It solves the problem of maintaining precise time without manual adjustment by automatically synchronizing with NTP servers.

## Problems Solved
- Manual time setting and adjustment
- Time drift in traditional clocks
- Inaccurate timekeeping without internet connectivity

## How It Works
1. On startup, the device connects to a configured WiFi network
2. Once connected, it synchronizes with NTP servers to get accurate time
3. The current time is continuously displayed on the OLED screen in HH:MM:SS format
4. A blue LED blinks to indicate the device is operational
5. Time is updated every second with NTP sync every 60 seconds

## User Experience Goals
- Minimal setup with WiFi credentials configuration
- Clear, readable time display
- Visual indication of device operation
- Reliable timekeeping with automatic synchronization
- Low power consumption for continuous operation
